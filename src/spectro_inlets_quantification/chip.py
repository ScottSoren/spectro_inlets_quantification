        This method should be called after the flux (n_dot or self.n_dot) has been
        calculated from signals using the sensitivity matrix. It converts the calculated
        fluxes to partial pressures of each molecule in the gas of the chip.
        This can be done in a few ways, specified by "mode":

        naive: This is the simplest. It assumes that EVERYTHING has a correctly-
            quantified flux. The partial pressure of a molecule in the chip is then just
            the total pressure in the chip times the portion that molecule makes up in
            the sum of the calculated fluxes.
            Advantages:
                Simple. No use of capillary equation.
                Robust against uniform (alpha-only) drift of sensitivity.
            Disadvantages:
                Convolutes uncertainty in each molecule's quantification with the
                    uncertainty in the quantification of all other molecules.
                Fails if there is a significant unquantified or poorly-quantified
                    component.

        water: This normalizes signals according to water's calculated vapour pressure.
            Advantages:
                Simple. No use of capillary equation.
                Robust against uniform (alpha-only) drift of sensitivity.
            Disadvantages:
                Convolutes uncertainty in each molecule's quantification with the
                    uncertainty in H2O's quantification, and the calculation of H2O's
                    vapour pressure calculation.
                Fails if there isn't water.

        mix_in: This is more complex. It lets the flux of the "relaxed" components of
            the carrier gas (typically just He) "float" in order to get the sum of the
            fluxes to match the flux as calculated by the capillary equation.
            See Chip.partial_pressure_by_mix_in for details.
            Advantages:
                Robust. Works without water, and works okay with significant
                    unquantified components (it assumes that they are extra carrier).
                Uses the sensitivity factors as absolute sensitivity factors - no
                    implicit normalization
            Disadvantages:
                Complex. Uses capillary equation. Requires convergence.
                Is influenced by uniform sensitivity drift.

        He_solver: Like mix_in, this adds in the "relaxed" components of the carrier gas
            (typically just He) until the total flux from the MS measurements matches the
            total flux from the capillary calculation. Unlike mix_in, it uses a linear
            solver rather than an iterative approach.
            Advantages:
                Robust. Works without water, and works okay with significant
                    unquantified components (it assumes that they are extra carrier).
                Uses the sensitivity factors as absolute sensitivity factors - no
                    implicit normalization
            Disadvantages:
                Complex. Uses capillary equation. Depends on solver.

        """Calculate the composition of the gas in the chip, both analyte and carrier

        This is a difficult, central, and subtle method in the quantification algorithm,
        so it requires some explanation.
        Functions such as Calibration.calc_n_dot() calculate the flux through the
        chip capillary of analyte molecules based on the MS signals. To calculate
        concentrations, we need to know the mass transfer function, which requires a
        calculation of the total capillary flux. However, the capillary flux depends,
        via the capillary equation, on the composition of the gas in the chip, which is
        some mix of quantified analyte molecules and as-of-yet unquantified (or only
        roughly quantified) molecules in the carrier gas. Sanity requires that the
        total capillary flux is equal to the sum of all the individual fluxes.
        This method takes an iterative approach to solving these almost-circular
        dependencies in calculating the total capillary flux and the composition of the
        gas in the chip. It is at present complex and non-intuitive, and thus a prime
        candidate for study, discussion, and revision.

        The algorithm it uses is:
        0. Start by assuming the gas in the chip only contains carrier gas, and
            define the apparent pressure in the chip to be the measured pressure.
        1. Calculate the total flux (n_dot_0) based on the temperature and
            apparent pressure and the gas assumed to be in the chip. If dampening, mix
            it with the previously calculated n_dot according to dampening.
        2. For each molecule with a flux quantified based on measured MS signals,
            unless that molecule is explicitly "relaxed", assume that molecule's
            fraction in the gas in the chip is equal to its measured flux divided by
            the total flux.
        3. If the sum of the mol fractions is not within the tolerance (default is
            1%) of unity:
            a. Set the apparent pressure to the actual pressure times this sum.
            b. Normalize the gas (i.e. divide each mol fraction by this sum), and
            c. repeat from step (1).
        4. If the sum of the mol fractions of the gas now assumed to be in the chip is
            within the tolerance (default is 1%) of unity, then we're good!
            a. Return the partial pressures

        Steps 1-3 occur in the "mixing loop". The reason that the mixing loop
        converges is as follows: When the analyte fractions are added to the gas
        without normalization (step 2), that will result in a sum of mol fractions
        greater than unity. This will result in an apparent pressure which is higher
        than the actual pressure (step 3), and the total capillary flux calculated in
        the next round (step 1) will be higher. With the same flux of the analyte
        molecules, that results in a smaller fraction for them (step 2),
        and a sum-of-fractions closer to unity, and thus an apparent pressure closer
        to the actual pressure.

        Args:
            gas_0 (str or dict): initial guess at the gas in the chip. By default,
                the initial guess is self.carrier
            n_dot (dict): trusted fluxes of molecules [pmol/s]. By default, n_dot will
                be self.n_dot_analyte
            p (float): pressure [Pa] if to be updated
            T (float): temperature [K] if to be updated
            relaxed (set of str): names of the molecules to "relax", see above.
            tolerance (float): how self-consistent the composition of the gas in the
                chip needs to be. Default is 0.01 (i.e. 1%)
            N_loop (int): maximum number of times in the mixing loop. Default is 20.
            dampening (float): The weighting the previously calculated n_dot_0
                compared to the new n_dot_0. dampening=0 uses only new. Default is 0.5

        Returns:
            dict: the composition of the gas in the chip with both analyte and carrier.
                Of the form {i:x^i} where x^i is the mol fraction of molecule i.

        Raises:
            StopIteration if the mixing loop does not converge after N_loop attempts.
